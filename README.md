# Spatial-Vector&Raster-Data-Processing-and-Visualisation

Welcome to my **GIS spatial data analysis project**. This project utilizes a variety of GIS tools and extensive data, particularly with the help of **QGIS**, an open-source Geographic Information System platform. I deal with **vector data** (such as **SHP** files and **GeoPackage**), **raster data** (like **TIFF**), and large **CSV** files with location information.

### I. How to Get Started
First, you need to install **[QGIS software](https://qgis.org/en/site/)** in order to open and process files. QGIS supports various types of data and provides a variety of tools for geospatial data processing, making it an essential tool for this project. Then, you can clone this repository to view and explore each branch and file '.qgz'

Alternatively, if you're not looking to replicate the project locally but are interested in the findings, you can simply navigate to the **'main'** branch and read the final report '[Geographical visualization report.pdf](https://github.com/ZominWang/Spatial-Vector-Data-Processing-and-Visualisation/blob/main/Geographical%20visualization%20report.pdf)'.  

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the project and its findings, including detailed descriptions and visualizations of the data processing steps.


And here's the main visualizations I've made.

### II. Branch Structure
This repository mainly includes three branches:

**'main'**: This branch contains the final report and original files of the project.

**'Spatial-Vector-Data-Processing-and-Visualisation'**: This branch contains the processing files of the project, including but not limited to preprocessing and cleaning of the original data, as well as data conversion, etc.

**'UGS_Analysis'**: This branch focuses on the analysis of urban green space (UGS) service levels. It also contains processing files related to vector data. All necessary external files to be loaded in the main file have been bundled into a single folder in this branch.

Please pay attention to the functions and purposes of the files when viewing the corresponding branches.

### III. File Description
The two '.qgz' files in the project are QGIS project files, which need to be opened with QGIS software. These files record the detailed process of data processing and analysis.

The main data types used in the project include:

**Vector data:** includes .shp (Shapefile) and .gpkg (GeoPackage) formats. These data are mainly used to store geographic spatial information, such as locations, routes, etc.

**Raster data:** '.tiff' format. These data are mainly used to store pixelized geographic information, such as topographic maps, satellite images, etc.

**CSV files:** These files contain hundreds of thousands of rows of data, mainly containing location information and 'GeoJSON data'. They are the main data sources for this project, used for analyzing commuting patterns and locations.
